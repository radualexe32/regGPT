A machine learning model that automatically fits the best regression line to any given dataset whose entries are of the form `(x, y)`.

## Dependencies

To setup this project first we will need to create our own virtual environment. To do this, run the file in the root directory,

```bash
$ .\build.sh
```

If your operating system is not Unix or MacOS then run the `*.bat` file instead.

```bash
> .\build.bat
```
